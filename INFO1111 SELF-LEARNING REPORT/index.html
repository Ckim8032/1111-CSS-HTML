    <h2>About the Survey</h2>
    <p>
        This survey goes beyond simply asking about your favorite brand. 
        This psychological study requires more detailed information to prove the hypothesis. 
        You must explain why your chosen brand is your favorite 
        and list the factors that differentiate it from other brands.
